The Elite Movement (Musketeers)

During the 2022 SGCI Coding Institute's final week there was a code-athon. Participants formed teams and were given a base code to manipulate to fit their research
question. Our team investigated the question: Do masks adherence policies reduce the spread of infection? 

We utilized the following packages in Python:

  --> Seaborn:used for making statistical graphics.

  --> Pandas:used for data cleaning and analysis.

  --> NumPy:used for working with arrays.

  --> Pillow:adds support for opening, and saving images.
  
Future goals: To manipulate the base code further so that it can fully support calculating our population size
